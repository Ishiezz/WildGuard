Changes needed:-
1. You can add introductory message or something appreciative  in the Basic tier, so the donation section can look evenly good.
2. Login and Register are looking quite different from other ones. 
3. Java script animations(pop zoom) are not working for the menu bars(login, register).
4. You can add more FAQs,like:-
  - What is WildGuard?
  -What types of wildlife does WildGuard protect?
  -How can I report a wildlife sighting or issue?
  -How does WildGuard collaborate with local communities?
